# Preface

This book is an introduction to the ARM Cortex-A AArch64 architecture and programming in the C language. Readers will learn the ARM Arch64 architecture by writing programs in ARM assembly and C programming languages. The book covers a subset of the instruction set architecture (ISA) and provides an introduction to the venerable C programming language. It strives to explain the relationship between code written in C and its equivalent in ARM assembly. The objective is to give readers a glimpse into what high-level code translates to in assembly language. Readers will understand things what happens on a function call, how values are passed into functions and returned from them etc. They will understand how control flow really works, what pointers are under the hood, and the real difference between passing by value or reference.

The material covered here could serve as the foundation to several other areas. It would be useful to anyone looking to pursue a career in embedded systems, compilers, OS development, computer security, or CPU verification. To make it accessible to a wider audience, it has been written so that readers require no prior experience in programming. Therefore, experienced programmers may find it a bit tedious and verbose. If you are one such reader, we encourage you to skim through the book dipping into areas that are new or interesting and skipping ones you already know.
