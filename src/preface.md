# Preface

This book is an introduction to the ARM Cortex-A AArch64 architecture and programming in the C language. Readers will learn the architecture by writing programs in ARM assembly and C programming languages. The book covers a subset of the instruction set architecture (ISA) and provides several exercises for readers to practise and develop familiarity with the ISA. Also included are important portions of the ARM architecture including interrupts and exceptions, exception levels, virtual memory etc. In addition to assembly programming the book also serves as an introduction to the venerable C programming language. The book strives to explain the relationship between code written in C and its equivalent in ARM assembly. The objective is to give readers a glimpse into what high-level code translates to in assembly language. Readers will understand things like what happens on a function call, how values are passed into functions and returned from them, and what is the overhead of function calls. They will understand how control flow really works, what pointers are under the hood, and the real difference between passing by value or reference.

The book would be useful to anyone looking to pursue a career in embedded systems, compilers, OS development, computer security, or CPU verification. To make it accessible to a wider audience, it has been written so that readers require no prior experience in programming. Therefore, experienced programmers may find it a bit tedious and verbose. If you are one such reader, we encourage you to skim through the book dipping into areas that are new or interesting and skipping ones you already know.
