# Conclusion

This concludes part one of the journey to learning ARM architecture and C programming. So far we have encountered the basics of AArch64 assembly language and the C programming language. We have learnt how C programs can be compiled to assembly code and and how a compiled binary can be disassembled back into assembly. We covered several user level AArch64 assembly instructions and some portion of the C programming syntax. 

However, what we have learnt is only the begining. In part 2 and beyond we will learn more AArch64 assembly and architecture - including exception levels, virtual memory, multi-processing, coherence etc. - and explore using those features using assembly and C programs.
